# The RBHPi Framework.

This is my personal PHP5.4+ framework. Humble and down to earth.

## Qualities of the Framework:

- Make as much use of PHP's core functionality as possible.
- Simple structure, opinionated.
- Compliance with FIG Standards.
- Disregard 'speed' and 'micro-optimizations' in favor of readability and elegance.
- Leave room for future adaptability and extensibility.
